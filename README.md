# CycleLip-Project
This repository contains codes relating to the integration of the lip2wav and wav2lip model for cycle consistency for training on a multi-speaker dataset, the dataset used was the Voxceleb2-dataset. This repository also contains a pytorch implementation of the lip2wav-multispeaker variant

The lip2wav and wav2lip base codes were not created by me so check out the amazing work in the links below
